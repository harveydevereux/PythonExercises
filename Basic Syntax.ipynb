    "Some languages are ''close to the machine'' in that they appear as\n",
    "archaic instructions or even a whole file of $1$s and $0$s. Others\n",
    "are much more human interpretable, putting more layers between the human and the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end though all programming languages are eventually converted into strings of $1$s and $0$s, since a computer only\n",
    "works with binary signals (like many lightbulbs switching on and off).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the binary nature of the computer is it's equivalence to logic i.e $1$ is equivalent to ```true/on``` and $0$ to ```false/off``` and the ease of representing ```on``` and ```off``` as electrical circuitry. These ''switches'' are combined into more ellaborate circuits to perform logical operations and store memory.\n",

    "Quantum and DNA computing. In these cases the machine works not\n",
